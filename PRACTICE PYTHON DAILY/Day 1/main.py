"""

"""Here are **five problems** for **Day 1: Variables & Operators** to help you practice variable assignment and arithmetic operations:

---

### **Problem 1: Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion**
Write a program to convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula:  
`F = (C * 9/5) + 32`.  
Ask the user for the Celsius temperature as input.

**Example Input**:  
`Enter temperature in Celsius: 25`  
**Example Output**:  
`25Â°C is 77.0Â°F`

### **Problem 2: Area of a Circle**
Write a program to calculate the area of a circle. Ask the user for the radius and use the formula:  
`Area = Ï€ * rÂ²`.  
Use `math.pi` for the value of Ï€.

**Example Input**:  
`Enter the radius of the circle: 5`  
**Example Output**:  
`The area of the circle is 78.54`

---

### **Problem 3: Swapping Two Variables**
Write a program to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.  
Ask the user for two numbers as input.

**Example Input**:  
`Enter the first number: 10`  
`Enter the second number: 20`  
**Example Output**:  
`After swapping: First number = 20, Second number = 10`

### **Problem 4: Simple Interest Calculation**
Write a program to calculate simple interest using the formula:  
`SI = (P * R * T) / 100`.  
Ask the user for the principal amount (`P`), rate of interest (`R`), and time (`T`).

**Example Input**:  
`Enter the principal amount: 1000`  
`Enter the rate of interest: 5`  
`Enter the time (in years): 2`  
**Example Output**:  
`The simple interest is 100.0`

---

### **Problem 5: Sum and Average of Three Numbers**
Write a program to take three numbers as input and calculate their sum and average.

**Example Input**:  
`Enter the first number: 10`  
`Enter the second number: 20`  
`Enter the third number: 30`  
**Example Output**:  
`Sum = 60`  
`Average = 20.0`

---

### **Bonus Challenge**:
- Add input validation to ensure the user enters valid numbers (e.g., no strings or negative values for temperature or radius).
