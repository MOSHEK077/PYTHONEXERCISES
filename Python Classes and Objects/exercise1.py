""" Python Classes/Objects:

Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

Create a Class """

#Create a Class:
#To create a class, use the keyword class:
#Class Myclass:
# #  a = 42
    
    

#    a = 5
    
#print(Myclass)

#  Object;
#  Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects:
#object creation

class MyFirstClass:
    a = "This is my First class."
objcls = MyFirstClass()
print(objcls.a)
